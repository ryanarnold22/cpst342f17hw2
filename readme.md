Hello, this is my second repository.
The members of this awesome project is just me, myself, and I. Ryan Arnold

After working with CSS and Bootstrap I have come to the conclusion that Bootstrap is much more intuitive to work with. I was about ready to pull my hair out with creating the 12 columns on CSS. It took many hours to finally "figure" it out. I say figure loosely because if asked to attempt again I'm sure I would still have problems all over again. The formatting wasn't as clear as it was on Bootstrap and adding col-1,col-2,col-3, etc... on CSS with the correct width % was confusing to say the least. 

I prefer Bootstrap because it appears to have a bunch of built-in features, like the nifty nav bar and the columns. It helped save some time in the end and made my experience attempting to program my site a bit more enjoyable. I would like to know if there is an easier way to go about CSS's grid system though? I enjoy the thought of creating something entirely by myself and for that reason I do enjoy CSS, but that column system really took me on a ride and gave me a killer migrane haha.
